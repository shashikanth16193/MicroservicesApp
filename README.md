MicroservicesApp

A Spring Boot Microservices-based application that demonstrates core microservices patterns like Service Discovery, API Gateway, Centralized Configuration, Authentication & Authorization with JWT


Implemented Features :-

auth-service :-

User login with email & password

JWT token generation with role-based access control (RBAC)

Role support: STUDENT, TEACHER, ADMIN


course-service :-

Teachers can create and manage courses

Students can view available courses


review-service :-

Students can post reviews for courses



api-gateway :-

Routes requests to appropriate services

Validates JWT tokens before forwarding

Implements Circuit Breaker & Rate Limiter using Resilience4j


eureka-server (Service Discovery) :-

Each service registers itself

Gateway & other services discover dynamically


config-server (Centralized Configuration) :-

Externalized configuration stored in Git repository

All services fetch config at startup


IN PROGRESS OR PARTIAL IMPLMENTATION   

Inter-Service Communication

Uses Feign Client and RestTemplate

Circuit Breaker and Rate Limiter on api-gateway


Tech Stack
